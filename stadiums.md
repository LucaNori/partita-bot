# Stadiums and Cities Configuration

Below is the YAML configuration used to map stadiums to their respective cities. Update this file to add or modify entries without changing the code.

```yaml
stadiums:
  - name: "Old Trafford"
    city: "Manchester"
  - name: "Anfield"
    city: "Liverpool"
  - name: "Camp Nou"
    city: "Barcelona"
  - name: "Allianz Arena"
    city: "Munich"
```

When new cities or stadiums need to be added, simply update this YAML section. The code will load this configuration to determine the proper mapping.
